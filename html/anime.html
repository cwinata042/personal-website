        <h2>Natsume Yuujinchou</h2>
        <p>
          This slice of life and supernatural story is one of my favorites.
          The story follows Natsume Takashi, a high schooler who can see ayakashi, who can be friendly or dangerous spirits.
          He is accompanied by his guardian Nyanko-sensei, who plans on taking the Book of Friends for himself.
          When he was young, he inherited a mysterious book of names from his deceased grandmother Reiko, and because of it, he is harrassed by these yokai on a daily basis.
          Each episode revolves around his encounters with certain yokai and the act of returning their names taken by Natsume's grandmother.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of all the anime I have watched, this was one of the most relaxing ones to watch, and I even ended up rewatching it multiple times.
          The series currently consists of 6 seasons, along with specials and movies.
          If you're looking for something interesting but slow-paced, this might be something perfect for you!

        <h2>91 Days</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike most anime I have enjoyed, 91 Days is a darker and more dramatic series about revenge.
          The story takes place during the Prohibition era, and it involves the mafia and speakeasies.
          The main character Angelo witnesses the slaughter of his family by the Vanetti mafia family, and when he grows older, he sets out to take revenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          My favorite part about this anime was the dynamic between the two main characters, Angelo and Nero.
          This was a show I could not stop watching in between because most of the episodes kept you on waiting for more.

        <h2>Durarara!!</h2>
        <p>
          Durarara!! is an intricate story of a large cast of characters who are seemingly unrelated to each other.
          However as the story proceeds, certain events end up tying these characters together and throwing them into a sea of chaos.
          With a diverse cast, each character has a pretty interesting backstory and personality.
          The story takes place in Ikebukuro, a district in Tokyo, Japan.
          The main character (in a way) is Mikado, a kid from the countryside who is convinced by his friend Kida to move to Tokyo, but he ends up getting dragged into the affairs of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a sense, a lot of the cast is their own main character in this series, and by the end, the overlapping stories can get a little confusing.
          This series involves a lot of supernatural elements and urban legends, such as a headless motorcyclist.
          Although I personally felt like the last few seasons were less impactful than the first, Durarara!! is an interesting combination of urban legends, eccentric characters, and mystery.

        <h2>Wotakoi</h2>
        <p>
          Wotakoi is by far my favorite romance anime, mainly because I love the mundane interactions between its memorable cast of characters.
          The main character is Narumi, a closet otaku who does not want her coworkers to find out she is an otaku.
          However, her old friend Hirotaka works at the same company as Narumi, and he blows her cover on her first day there.
          Luckily enough, the two people who hear happen to also be otakus themselves, and thus begins their friendship!
        </p>
        <p>
          As an avid fan of the slice of life genre, Wotakoi brings a story that does not need a compelling story to entertain.
          With a smaller cast of four main characters and two side characters, you get to learn about each character in depth and relate to their struggles.
          The chemistry between the main characters is the main reason why I loved this show!

        <h2>Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan</h2>
        <p>
          Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan is an interesting anime to say the least.
          The cast of characters are so eccentric and...well, crazy, that you feel very confused when you first start watching.
          However, the short, 5 minute episodes quickly teach you that the point of this anime is to be confusing yet hilarious.
          Saiki Kusuo is a pyschic living in a normal world, but despite being the least normal person on paper, the people he is surrounded by are by far stranger than he is.
          Each episode is about him trying to live a normal life, only for those plans to be ruined by "normal" people.
        </p>
        <p>
          The humor used in this anime is golden, and it is a perfect way to relax and laugh until your stomach hurts.
          However, episodes can feel extremely random, so if you aren't into that, maybe look elsewhere!

        <h2>Mahoutsukai no Yome</h2>
        <p>
          Mahoutsukai no Yome is a beautiful and moving anime about a girl Chise Hatori who is sold to a mysterious masked man, a magus.
          Having been abandoned at a young age and bullied by her peers, she has no will to live until she meets Elias.
          She begins her new life as Elias' apprentince and moves to his cottage in England, which is surrounded by mythical beings and magic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mahoutsukai no Yome is a series that drew me in and kept me watching until the very end.
          The story, art, and music (everything really) was absolutely amazing!
